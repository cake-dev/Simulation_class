    "### Random placement - gas\n",
    "One of the trickiest aspects of molecular dynamics simulations is the specification of initial conditions.  This is a result of the strong repulsive forces of the Lennard-Jones force.  If particles are randomly placed too close together, we'll get a rather extreme force that will quickly turn into an unreasonably fast particle and the simulation will explode.  As such, **begin by devising a subroutine that randomly places $N$ particles such that no two are closer than $2^\\frac{1}{6} \\sigma$.**  Look at Gould 8.4 for inspiration.  Using this routine, randomly place 10 particles in a domain that is size $L\\times L$, with $\\sigma=\\epsilon=1$.  Set initial velocities to normally-distributed random values with standard deviation $\\sigma=5$.  Use a time step of $\\Delta t=0.001$ and run the simulation for $10$ units of time.  "

    "### Rectangular lattice - the liquid phase\n",
    "The situation above essentially corresponds to a vacuum: the pressure is close to zero because the particle are not squeezed together except during occasional repulsive interactions (**The pressure is proportional to the potential energy.  Add a routine to your LennardJones class that computes the Lennard-Jones potential, Gould Eq. 8.2**).  Non-interactive particles such as Argon thus tend to be gases at low pressures.  However, as we squeeze these particles together we can get them to behave like a liquid, which has a uniform density but where particles are still free to move around.  To simulate particles at higher pressure, we'll need to place them so that the density is greater than that achievable through random placment, but also such that the intermolecular forces approximately balance so that we don't get an explosion.  One reasonable starting configuration is a simple cartesian grid.  **Perform the same simulation as above, but with the particles initially placed on a grid with unit spacing.**  Accounting for periodic boundary conditions and again using $L=10$, this implies that you should have 100 particles.
