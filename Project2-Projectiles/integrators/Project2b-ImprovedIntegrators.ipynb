Because we will be modelling many such systems, it will be helpful to develop a convenient framework for operating on such systems.  In particular, we would like to develop an object oriented framework for working with these problems so that we can reuse as much code as possible (while also keeping our code nice).  We will continue to modify these methods as we require additional functionality, but these will form a good start.  \n",
